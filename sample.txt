Life in the city moves at the speed of light. People are always on the go, chasing deadlines and trying to make ends meet. For Maya, a young graphic designer, every day felt like a rat race. She had her nose to the grindstone from morning till night, but the recognition she craved was still just out of reach.

One day, after her boss threw her under the bus for a failed client pitch, she decided she’d had enough. “I’m not going to be the scapegoat anymore,” she thought. So, she took a leap of faith and started freelancing. It was a tough road at first—money was tight, and jobs were few and far between. But Maya knew that Rome wasn’t built in a day.

Slowly but surely, word of mouth worked in her favor. Clients started to roll in, and soon she had more projects than she could shake a stick at. Though the path was rocky, Maya trusted the process and finally began to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
